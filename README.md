Full stack responsive web application designed to conviently showcase my skills and contact me.

## Overview
Partridge Web Solutions is a full stack responsive web application developed using the ASP.NET Core MVC architecture. Several APIs were incorporated into the project, including the CoinGecko API, from which crypto pricing data is aggregated and displayed in an interactive chart. The website was designed with SEO in mind to improve search rankings and increase accessibility to users. The project is hosted on a HostGator server. The CloudFlare was chosen as the DNS to improve security and website load time.
